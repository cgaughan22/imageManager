              <h5>Sunrises and Sunsets</h5>
              <p>I am a sunset and sunrise lover. Photographing these two majestic gifts of nature bring so much perspective to life.  The colors that each unique sunrise and sunset hold are breath taking.  Sunrises and sunsets photographed anywhere enhances our senses in an amazing way.  Photographing the perfect shot takes a lot of patience, dedication and a real understanding of photography.  I invite you to check out my nature gallery where you can purchase the beautiful scenes I have been able to capture.  Because I appreciate you I have a lot of options for you and would be more than happy to frame whatever size suits your tastes.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do :)</p>
